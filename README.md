# Rhizome Mocks
Various equipment mocks for testing the interface with the Rhizome.

### Use
1) Create a new project in Particle Build.
2) Add the fake_rhizome.ino file as your main .ino file.
3) Add the equipment you want from the lib folder.
4) Wire things up appropriately.

### Note
Currently, the fake_rhizome.ino file is set up to show you how to use each mock we've got so far. Hence, it may have more or less than you actually want for your purposes. Plan accordingly, and update it as we add more mocks!
